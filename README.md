# Overview

In the current scenario, colleges are having multiple communities. These communities are having events on weekly basis. But due to lack of communication between students and communities members, many events go unnoticed by students of other communities as well. Also, there are number of events related to college, not just communities, which the students get to know at the last moment and they are not able to prepare for that event beforehand accordingly.

The project aims to solve this problem by centralizing the information regarding communities and college by giving such a platform where a user irrespective of its community can get knowledge about other communities and college events, by bridging the gap between students and college and community members. It aims at building an android application that will be useful at college level especially for students so that they may never miss any event and actively participate in them.

The application will provide the users with the latest updates of their college, i.e., what is happening around the campus, when it is going to happen. Also it focuses on the communities of college, all the updates about the events that will going to happen in any community. This project is inspired by real life problem that usually students in any college face.

The project contains seven main modules.

•	Login	: The user needs to login with their email and the respective password for the application. If it’s a new user then they first have to register themselves on the application which can be done through Signup module. 

•	Registration/SignUp : This module is mainly for the new users. The users which are new to the application needs to get registered before using this application. Once they have registered themselves they can login the application.

•	Home : This module is the main module. Here all the updates of both college and communities are shown. It has three section as All, College and Communities. All section will show combined updates of both College and Communities.

•	College : This module categorizes the updates regarding college. There are categories as Events, Seminars, Placement, Workshops, Others. The user can select the category according to its need.

•	Communities : This module shows all the communities that are registered with some details of each of them. If a user wants updates of only one particular community then he can select that community and view the regarding updates.

•	Settings : User can change their password or email address they entered at the time of registration.

•	About : This module shows information about the application and its features.
